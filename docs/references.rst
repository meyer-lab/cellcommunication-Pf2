RISE Paper
----------

CCC-RISE is built upon the RISE framework for single-cell analysis across conditions.

Integrative, high-resolution analysis of single-cell gene expression across experimental conditions with PARAFAC2-RISE. *Cell Systems*, 2025. DOI: `10.1016/j.cels.2025.101294 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2025.101294>`_

Tensor Decomposition Methods
-----------------------------

CCC-RISE combines CP (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) decomposition with PARAFAC2 to analyze the four-dimensional structure of cell-cell communication data. PARAFAC2 allows factor matrices in one mode to change across slices while maintaining a constant cross-product constraint.
